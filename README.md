**Description:**  Stellar will be a web application that allows the user to discover new music stars on the rise. Using data from music websites, the app will display an Artist profile and play sample music by the artist. The user can read a bio, browse pictures, and listen to a few short samples of music, then if the user likes the artist they can either save them into their “star” list or discard them. This user interaction will be similar to the “swiping” action of Tinder. The user will be able to view all of their saved artists and information. 
	This application will utilize web scraping and APIs to gather the data needed to display information and music for the user. The UI will be a clean, material design interface that allows the user to seamlessly navigate and interact with the application. The app will feature a leaderboard of artists, and the most-swiped artist will be at the top. These features allow a fun and interactive experience for the user to discover new music. 

**Vision Statement**: To create a clean and intuitive web application that will empower people to discover new artists and musicians  

**Motivation:** The motivation for this project is simple: we all love music, and we love finding new music. However, it’s often surprisingly difficult to find new music that fits your specific taste. Because of this, we’ve decided to develop a simple, clean app that will let users discover new top artists and music that they enjoy.

**Risks:** We have to learn new languages,  and it is not easy to access data from Youtube or Spotify. Some teammates have no experience in web developing. We have to learn and develop a rating system for artists. It is also necessary to learn how to use databases and Web Storage, and we need to find the best data structure for our data.

**Risk Mitigation** Plan: We can group our project risks into two basic groups: a lack of experience with the required tools, and the difficulty of implementing our specific ideas.   
Not everyone in our team has experience with web development let alone full stack development. In order for this project to succeed, the team members will need to learn new languages and tools with which we will implement our ideas. This particular risk will be easier to overcome, because we are students, and much of the material we will need to learn will be covered in our various classes. For the material that isn’t covered in classes, we plan to utilize the endless resources available around the web and in the university including teachers, TA’s, course materials, and online tutorials and references. Using these resources, we will certainly be able to overcome the challenges of learning to use new tools.
	The second group of risks — finding the best ways to use our chosen tools in order to accomplish our goals — will prove more challenging to overcome. In order to gather data from Youtube, our team plans to search for any available APIs released by Youtube, Spotify, or other groups, and to take full advantage of the extensive resources available online. Developing a rating system should not prove to be too difficult, as it will likely involve the deriving of a simple equation utilizing either graph theory, differential equations, or linear matrices to rank the musical artists. Finally, the design of our database and data structures will be accomplished by slowly breaking down our dataset and using the process of normalization that we learned in class. 
	By following this general plan, our team will be able to overcome the risks involved and create a polished final product that we are satisfied with.

**Version Control:** For our project we will be using Github for our version control. 

**Development Method:** We will be following the agile method. The agile method divides the project into a smaller tasks and works on each task in incremental order.

**Collaboration Tool:** Slack.

**Proposed Architecture:** We will be using React for our frontend development and SQL for our backend development.
